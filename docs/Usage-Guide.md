# Usage Guide

## Supported tables

See [`TablesConfiguration`](/src/Models/TablesConfiguration.cs) for a full list of supported tables and columns. This integration currently anonymizes the data contained in the following tables:

- CMS_Country
- CMS_Email
- CMS_State
- CMS_User
- CMS_UserSettings
- COM_Address
- COM_Customer
- COM_OrderAddress
- OM_Account
- OM_Contact

## Adding your tables

If the list of [supported tables](#supported-tables) doesn't meet your needs, you can modify the `anonymizer_tables.json` file to add your own tables. This file is automatically generated when running the tool for the first time, and can be found in the directory the tool is executed from. If the directory doesn't contain this file, you can run the tool and cancel (CTRL+C) before answering the prompts.

For example, you may want to anonymize data entered in your forms:

```json
{
  "Tables": [
    {
      "TableName": "DancingGoat_ContactUs",
      "AnonymizeColumns": [
        "Name",
        "Email",
      ]
    },
    // Other tables...
}
```
